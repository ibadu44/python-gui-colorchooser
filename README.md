# python-gui-colorchooser
A simple GUI application that lets you pick a color and applies it to the window, built using Python's Tkinter library. This project demonstrates how to use the colorchooser dialog to get a color from the user and dynamically update the GUI's appearance. It is a great way to learn about interactive dialogs in Tkinter.
